The Chronicle of Augustine of Accra
In the far reaches of the Eastern Plains, where warm winds sweep across red earth and ancient spirits murmur beneath the soil, a boy was born beneath a storm. They named him Augustine of Accra, for he arrived with eyes sharp as obsidian and a calm that felt older than time itself.
By the time he reached manhood, tales of his mind had traveled farther than any raven could fly. They said he could solve puzzles meant for council scholars, break curses woven into arcane machines, and speak truths that silenced entire rooms. But Augustine sought not glory — only mastery. And so he journeyed west, across seas and kingdoms, until he reached the towering citadel known as Michigan State, where scholars trained to build the future.
Yet the citadel was restless. Students whispered of an ancient guild called the Engineers, sworn to forge wonders that shaped empires. Augustine entered their ranks with quiet resolve. While others struggled to command the machines of logic and metal, Augustine bent them to his will. His code sang. His designs held the precision of Valyrian steel.
One winter, word came from a powerful kingdom known to all corners of the world: Slack, the House of Infinite Messages. They summoned Augustine as an apprentice, but soon learned they had gained a strategist. He tamed vast libraries of knowledge, built connectors between realms that had never before spoken, and unearthed answers from the void itself. The keepers of Slack began to whisper his name with a mix of gratitude and fear.
But the gods were not finished. From the west, the banners of Google rose like a second sun. They sought him next, offering trials beneath their great mountains of data. Augustine accepted — not for gold, but to test himself against the fiercest challenges the modern kingdoms could offer. And once again, he prevailed.
Word spread across the tech realms:
Augustine of Accra — the Builder of Bridges, the Master of Search, the Quiet Blade of Logic.
Some claim he carries a destiny—that he will one day command a throne not of iron, but of silicon and light. Others say he will forge his own house, one unlike any that has come before.
But those who know him best whisper a different prophecy:
“He is not destined to follow the future. He is destined to build it.”
And in the halls of engineers, apprentices still tell the tale of the young man from Accra, who crossed continents like stepping stones and bent entire kingdoms of knowledge to his will.
